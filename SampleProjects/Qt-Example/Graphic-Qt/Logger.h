/**
 * This Logger class provides a simple interface to log messages with different importance (debug/info/warning/error/fatal)
 * and write them to the console and a log file (in the working dir).
 * The interface was designed to behave like the standard c++ output interface, "cout", and is implemented as a singelton class.
 *
 * Usage examples:
 *   first set loglevels:   Logger::SetLogLevelForConsole(Logger::ERROR);
 *			    Logger::SetLogLevelForFile(Logger::DEBUG);
 *
 *  then write to different targets just like to cout:
 *	Logger::error() << "This is an error message" << Logger::endl;
 *	Logger::debug() << "This is a debug message" << Logger::endl;
 *
 * -------------
 *
 * The class is nested and uses templates, that's why definitions and internals which should
 * actually be in a cpp-file are located in the header-file, and that's why some things may look strange.
 *
 * It's better to only use the class instead of trying to understand the internal parts of it :-)
